title: "Intern in the Computational Imaging Group (Sony)"
excerpt: " In 2015, I joined Sony Deutschland Gmbh (more precisely the Stuttgart Technology center) where I accomplished a 6 months internship. It was my very first working experience, projecting me in a very international environment with very skilled people. At Sony, I learned to convert academic skills into concrete industrial inputs, delivering algorithm implementation from reading state-of-the-art related articles.

	I worked in the Computational Imaging Group, and my task consisted essentially in delivering a light field toolbox. I learned the topic from scratch and did my first steps with Computer Vision applications. The link above provides a more detailed overview about this experience."

## Overview

During my internship at Sony Deutschland GmbH at the Stuttgart Technology Center from September 2015 to February 2016, I worked within the Computational Imaging Group of EuTEC (European Technology Centre). This group conducts cutting-edge research in areas such as Computational Photography, Machine Learning, Communications & Radar Systems, and Speech & Sound Processing.

I contributed to the "Computational Photography" project, focusing on the development of 3D scene reconstruction from multi-camera arrays. The purpose of multi-camera arrays is to capture a broader or more detailed set of visual data than a single camera can provide. By using multiple cameras arranged in specific configurations, these arrays enable a variety of applications across different fields such as: 

- **Depth perception and 3D imaging**: Multi-camera arrays are commonly used for 3D reconstruction. By capturing the same scene from different angles, the system can calculate depth information, allowing for the creation of detailed 3D models or the generation of depth maps.
- **Improved Image Quality**: Combining inputs from several cameras can enhance image quality through techniques like image stitching, allowing for higher resolution, dynamic range, and more accurate color reproduction.
- **Wide-Angle Coverage**: With multiple cameras, a larger field of view can be captured. This is especially useful in surveillance systems or in autonomous vehicles where a comprehensive view of the environment is required to detect obstacles and ensure safety.
- **Several interesting features**: By combining different filters on each cameras (e.g. Red, Green, Blue or Near Infrared Radiation filters instead of regular RGB), the image reconstruction offers a wide variety of application, such as vein detection, object recognition or noise reduced images.

My main responsibilities in the project included:

- Conducting a litterature research on relevant algorithms
- Implementing and benchmarking algorithms in Matlab
- Improve their performance by translating Matlab implementations into C++
- Implementation of different light field features (e.g. vein detection, noise reduction) on a GPU
- Documenting results and presenting them regularly to the team
