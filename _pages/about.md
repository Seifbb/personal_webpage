# excerpt: "AI/ML Research Scientist | Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics"
---

I am an AI/ML Research Scientist with a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. Over the past 2 years, I have had the opportunity to work in the industry, developing machine learning solutions focused on cybersecurity and biomedical applications. My work revolves around translating complex mathematical theories into practical AI systems that have a real-world impact.

Passionate about bridging the gap between academic research and industry, I specialize in anomaly detection, unsupervised learning, time-series and natural language processing. I thrive on tackling tough, complex problems and finding innovative solutions. 

I am always looking for new challenges where I can apply my interdisciplinary expertise to drive technological advancements and make a difference in the world.
